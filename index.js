        <p><strong>Interests:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Football:</strong> My favourite player is Messi â€” to me, he is the best footballer in the world.</li>
            <li><strong>Tennis:</strong> Roger Federer never fails to surprise me. He plays with such elegance that he makes it look effortless.</li>
            <li><strong>Basketball:</strong> I enjoy the energy and strategy of the game it keeps me on my toes.</li>
            <li><strong>Music:</strong> I keep an open mind. I love artists like Mariah Carey, Drake, Giveon, and Michael Jackson. Whatever sounds good to my ears ends up in my playlist.</li>
            <li><strong>Classical:</strong> I am currently into Sergei Rachmaninoff Piano Concerto No. 2, especially the last 3 minutes. It feels like paradise on earth.</li>
